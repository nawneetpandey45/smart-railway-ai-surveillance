# Smart Railway AI Surveillance System (Original Idea)

## Project Type
Conceptual AI Innovation Project

## Idea Description
An AI-powered railway security system that verifies passengers using face recognition and detects suspicious activities in train bogies.

## Key Features
- AI face recognition-based passenger verification
- Bogie and seat-level scanning system
- Blacklist criminal detection
- Overcrowding and abnormal behavior detection
- Automatic alert system to authorities
- Evidence snapshot capture system

## Special Feature: Ticketless Passenger Detection

If a person is found sitting in a bogie and row without a valid ticket entry in the database,  
the system automatically captures their photo using the camera and immediately sends  
an alert to the Ticket Checker (TT) via Gmail.

The alert email contains:
- Passenger face snapshot
- Bogie number
- Row number
- Date and time of detection

This helps prevent ticketless travel in real time.
